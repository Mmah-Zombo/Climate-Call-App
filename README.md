### ABOUT

This is a version 2 of the `Save Your Home Weather App` that I built a few months ago. This version pf the app will upgrade the existing functionality and add new functionality to the app.

## RUN THE APP

After cloning the repo, run the following command in your `Ubuntu` terminal to setup the database configurations:
```linux
php artisan migrate
```

then you you bring the CSS into your code by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

then in your `Ubuntu` terminal run this command:
```linux
php artisan serve
```

"""Runnig the above command in `Bash` terminal will work provider it is setup properly."""

After running the command click in the url displayed in your terminal by doing `ctrl` + `shift` + click; or you copy and paste the url in your browser.
